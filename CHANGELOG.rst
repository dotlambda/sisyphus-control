++++++++++++++++

[3.1.4] - 2024-08-30
====================
Changed
-------
- Switch to socketio_v4 (#8) (thanks @bdraco!)

[3.1.3] - 2023-06-08
====================
Fixed
-----
* Removed usages of `asyncio.coroutine` so that the library can run on Python 3.11
Changed
-------
* Updated all dependency versions in `requirements.txt`

[3.1.2] - 2021-12-13
====================
Changed
-------
* Relax version requirements for socketio/engineio

[3.1.1] - 2021-10-21
====================
Changed
-------
* Re-enabled support for Python 3.8 (Home Assistant won't remove that until next year)

[3.1] - 2021-10-21
==================
Added
-----
* Python types for the entire API
* `Table.firmware_version` and `Table.mac_address`
Fixed
-------
* `find_table_ips` returns an empty list rather than `None` if none are found
* An error result returned from a POST request is now properly included in the Exception
* Locked dependency versions of `python-socketio` and `python-engineio` to those that support the SocketIO protocol version used by Sisyphus

[3.0] - 2020-09-06
==================
Added
-----
* Track remaining/total time support (requires recent firmware)
* Test shell program
Changed
-------
* Reworked the data model to match how Sisyphus itself does it. This fixes crashes that were occurring working with tables that have the latest firmware, but may break things with older firmwares.
* Switched to `python-socketio` for Socket.IO support, as it is more actively maintained than `SocketIO-client-nexus`.
* Switched to VSCode for development

==================
Added
-----

Added
-----

* Timeouts are now properly treated as socket connect timeouts instead of total time timeouts
* SocketIO socket properly closed on exception

[2.0] - 2018-05-20
====================

Changed
-------
* Changed the package name from ``sisyphus.control`` to ``sisyphus_control`` so as to be more ecosystem-friendly

[1.1.1] - 2018-05-10
====================

Changed
-------
Updated requirements to newer versions and pruned unnecessary ones.

[1.1.0] - 2018-05-10
====================

Added

Changed
-------
* ``Table.close`` must now be called when the ``Table`` is no longer needed, either directly or via ``async with``

Removed
-------
* ``Playlist.get_track_by_index`` (doesn't make sense; ``get_tracks`` already returns the tracks in sorted order)

Just getting this code out there. I've done some manual testing locally but haven't yet dreamt up a reasonable way to
automate the tests. Next step is to hook this in to Home Assistant!
